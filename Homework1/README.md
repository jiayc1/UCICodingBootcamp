# Homework 1 - Code Refactor 

# Acceptance Criteria 1: 
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

# Explanation: 
For acceptance criteria 1- to make the changes to the fix, we need to make sure that the source code is following the semantic HTML elements. To do this - we will need to change the code to follow header, section, nav, main, article, aside, and footer. In addition, once I have made those changes in html, I would have to make those changes in CSS where we would change some of the css div to nav. 


# Acceptance Criteria 2: 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

# Explanation: 
For acceptance criteria 2 - we made changes to the head where we switch the title to be the second line and have the CSS styling sheet in the third line. When you put the css style sheet below the title, you would be able to load the CSS and this is for SEO purposes so that SEO hits it right away reading from top to bottom. 

# Acceptance Criteria 3: 
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

# Explanation: 
For acceptance criteria 3 - all the images that are in html have an alt attribute added. 

# Acceptance Criteria 4: 
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

# Explanation 
For acceptance criteria 4 - we have to make sure that they are in sequential order of heading attributes. The only changes that I see that need to be done is the footer where it would need to be changed to h4 instead of h2. Setting these heading attributes gives engine a way to see what is important. 

# Acceptance Criteria 5: 
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# Explanation 
For acceptance criteria 5 - instead of the title to be website, we need to maek sure that it is sa description title. As a result, instead of website, I am changing that to "Horiseon - SEO Marketing Service"
